# NixOS Dotfiles
![NixOS Screeshot](nixos-screenshot/png)
These are the config files that manage my NixOS development workstation. It is designed to be a lightweight but fun to use development experience featuring just a tiling window manager, terminal emulator, and lazyvim (for now). It reverse proxies port 3000 to a local domain (with the help of pihole local dns set up on another machine).
